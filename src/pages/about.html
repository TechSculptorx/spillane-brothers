                        Each and every one of our projects is treated with the same core values that characterise our
                        company – honesty, integrity, professional advice and quality craftsmanship. In fact, honesty
                        and trust are the very cornerstones of our business.

                                    that will guarantee safety. It is an ongoing & varying process that requires
                                    engagement,
                                    attention & understanding. It’s very easy to get overwhelmed by large documents with
                                    incomprehensible language. This leads to dis-engagement & removes the opportunity
                                    for
                                    understanding. At Spillane Brothers, we try to keep the process as simple and

                                    as possible. A simple message that is understood, is many times more effective than
                                    an
                                    all bases covered essay that isn't.</p>

                                <p>Too often in our industry, the concept of good customer service takes a back seat to
                                    commercial concerns i.e. the pursuit of extras. This can be a cultural issue, or it
                                    can
                                    be generated by an adversarial attitude resulting from a lack of trust between the
                                    Client & Contractor (on one side, or both). Unfortunately, such attitudes have been
                                    forged, and remain, as a result of poor customer service. We believe in partnership
                                    and
                                    cooperation and will always prioritise customer service.</p>
