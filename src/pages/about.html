                        Each and every one of our projects is treated with the same core values that characterise our
                        company – honesty, integrity, professional advice and quality craftsmanship. In fact, honesty
                        and trust are the very cornerstones of our business.

                            <p>Safety isn't a destination. There isn't a perfect combination of paperwork and planning
                                that will guarantee safety. It is an ongoing & varying process that requires engagement,
                                attention & understanding. It’s very easy to get overwhelmed by large documents with
                                incomprehensible language. This leads to dis-engagement & removes the opportunity for
                                understanding. At Spillane Brothers, we try to keep the process as simple and engaging
                                as possible. A simple message that is understood, is many times more effective than an
                                all bases covered essay that isn't.</p>

                            <p>Too often in our industry, the concept of good customer service takes a back seat to
                                commercial concerns i.e. the pursuit of extras. This can be a cultural issue, or it can
                                be generated by an adversarial attitude resulting from a lack of trust between the
                                Client & Contractor (on one side, or both). Unfortunately, such attitudes have been
                                forged, and remain, as a result of poor customer service. We believe in partnership and
                                cooperation and will always prioritise customer service.</p>
